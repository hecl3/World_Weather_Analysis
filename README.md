# World_Weather_Analysis

Here we took some data with a few parameters input by the user to determine where their ideal vacation would be. First we took a random list of cities from around the world and then filtered it by weather, i.e. min and max temperature, winds, cloudiness, etc. By having the user input a preferred min and max temperature, a list of cities was pulled up that fit those parameters. Going further, we could pick four of those cities within a certain range as an itinerary, a hotel in each, as well as travel method to each.
